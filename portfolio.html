                        Rap is often stereotyped as one of the most misogynistic music genres, but whether or not this is true is unclear. 
                        In this study, we examined whether the stereotyped rap song is misogynistic as many people have believed 
                        using tools of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Statistical Analysis, and Data Visualization.
                        We examines lyrics from songs of all genres, including rap, creating semantic vectors from these lyrics, 
                        and comparing them with misogynist words and phrases, which aims to quantitatively assess the presence of misogyny in different music genres.

                            In MLB, where top-tier talent extensions are common, the Atlanta Braves stand out, committing $735 million in five years to secure their roster. 
                            Unlike traditional approaches, they prioritize young players. This paper explores their model, focusing on key players like Ronald Acuña Jr., 
                            Ozzie Albies, and others. Through statistical analysis, we uncover qualities valued by the Braves, aligning with their organizational philosophy. 
                            By examining player profiles and team stats, we reveal insights into the Braves' distinctive talent management approach, sustaining their competitiveness in the MLB.

                            As defending champions, the Golden State Warriors have faced heightened scrutiny due to their fluctuating performance this season. 
                            This report assesses the team's strengths and weaknesses, focusing on various aspects including player performances, team dynamics, 
                            and strategic insights. Utilizing public data from NBA statistical platforms, the analysis covers five key areas: Klay Thompson's 
                            impact during winning streaks, post All-Star first quarter performances, regression analysis on 3-point shooting efficiency, starters 
                            versus bench players, and a critical evaluation of Jordan Poole's contribution. By examining these factors, we gain valuable insights 
                            into the challenges the Warriors face in securing a playoff spot in the Western Conference.

                        <p3>
                            The Golden State Warriors, once heralded for their formidable performance, have recently encountered a perplexing losing streak despite notable achievements earlier in the season.
                             This paper delves into the underlying factors contributing to their downturn, examining issues such as lineup challenges, the impact of key players like Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, 
                             and the team's offensive and defensive efficiency. Utilizing play-by-play data from pbpstats, the analysis spans the period from the start of the season to the onset of the losing streak, 
                             shedding light on fluctuations in Stephen Curry's shooting, the absence of Draymond Green, and shifts in offensive and defensive performance. By dissecting these elements, this study offers 
                             valuable insights into the struggles facing the Golden State Warriors and provides potential pathways for improvement.
