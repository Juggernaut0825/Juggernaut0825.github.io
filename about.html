                        <br> My name is Zijian (Michael) Wang, and I started my college studies at Emory University in 2021 and gradually developed an interest in the field of Quantitative and Data Science after taking intro-level courses of Statistics and Data Science. <br>
                        <br> Declaring Quantitative Science Major with Data Science Track and Computer Science minor, I have become more enthusiastic with data science, computer science, programming, and statistics. Meanwhile I learned programming languages including Java, Python, R, SQL, C, etc. to perform more complicated research analysis, and I've developed skills in Data Analytics, Data Engineering, and Natural Language Processing. I'm also intrigued by all sorts of real-world applications extending the knowledge from classroom, especially something fancy, like the field of sports analytics, which motivates me to gain some experience in internship, data analytics competitions, projects, and research opportunities in various areas and fields. For more information about past work, please refer to <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>.<br>
                        <br> In my free time, I would play basketball and work out, watch NBA games (huge fan of the best team in NBA! Take a guess which team), enjoy my day with music (primarily Jazz or Pop Music), play saxophone, and sometimes go for outdoor activities like travelling, hiking or fishing (not so recently because trapped by academic tasks).<br>
