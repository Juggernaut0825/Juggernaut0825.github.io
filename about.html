                            My name is Michael Wang, and I started my college studies at Emory University in 2021 and gradually developed an interest in the field of Quantitative and Data Science. <br>
                            <br>
                            My major is Quantitative Science Major with Data Science Track, and his minor is Computer Science. I'm enthusiastic with data science, computer science, programming, and statistics, and be able to use Java, Python, R and many programming languages. I'm also intrigued by all sorts of real-world applications of the knowledge from classroom, especially in the field of sports analytics, which motivates him to gain some experience in internship, data analytics competitions, and writing data analytical reports.
